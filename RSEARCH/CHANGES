Changes between version 1.1 and 1.0
===================================
1.  Altered what states you can take beginsc jump into or endsc jump out of
to match INFERNAL

2.  Integrated more recent INFERNAL code

3.  Added --cmquery option, which reads in an infernal CM as query and then
proceeds as usual

4.  Added --productweights option to makernamat to create matrices where
the weight of two sequences are multiplied to get their joint weight rather
than averaged
