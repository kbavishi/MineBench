RSEARCH version 1.1 installation instructions

RSEARCH can be installed as either the normal version or the MPI
version.  For the normal version, you get two binary files --
"rsearch," which is the main program, and "makernamat," which makes
the matrices from a structural RNA alignment.  The MPI version
consists of only one binary -- "mpirsearch" -- that is an MPI version
of the main program.  The MPI binaries and the standard binaries need
to be compiled separately.  If you wish to compile both within the
same distribution, make sure to run "make binclean" between the two
compiles.  Otherwise, you may get compile-time linking errors.

The steps to installing RSEARCH are as follows:

1.  Configure the program with ./configure.  You can simply run the
    command without any options if you wish to compile the standard
    version and install it under /usr/local.  The following options
    may also be used:
	--prefix=DIR		Install binaries in DIR/bin and data
				files in DIR/share/rsearch
	--exec-prefix=DIR	Install binaries in DIR/bin
	--with-mpi		Compile MPI version (default is NO)
	
2.  Make the program with "make."

3.  Install the program with "make install."  Be sure you are root if
    you need to be.

4.  Run "make binclean" and repeat from step 1 if you wish to install
    both MPI and non-MPI versions.
