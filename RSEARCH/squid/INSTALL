Quick start
---------------
For a source distribution (example: squid.tar.gz), on a UNIX system:

   gunzip squid.tar.gz   Uncompresses the archive.
   tar xf squid.tar      Unpacks the archive. 
                             (makes a new directory, squid)
   cd squid              Moves into the distribution toplevel directory.
   ./configure               Configures the software for your system.
   make                      Builds the binaries. 
   make check                (optional) Runs the testsuite.	
   make install              (optional) Installs the software. 
                                (You may need to be root to install.)
   make clean                (optional) Cleans up.
   make deinstall	 Deletes SQUID from your system... assuming you 
                         haven't changed the Makefile since you installed. 
                         (may need to be root.)
 
Note that the software doesn't have to be "installed" to run. After
the "make", it's sitting in the squid directory and you can test it
out there, or copy any of the executables anywhere you want by hand. 

Any failure to install on a UNIX system is a bug. Please report it.

Man pages are provided for some programs; see Man/ subdirectory.

More fancy configuration instructions:
----------------------------------------
The only command you should want to putz around with is the
./configure; for instance, you may want to change where SQUID is going
to be installed. The default is to install into /usr/local/bin and
other /usr/local subdirectories as follows: 
         executables in   /usr/local/bin
         man pages in     /usr/local/man/man1
         header files in  /usr/local/include
         libsquid.a in    /usr/local/lib
         scripts in       /usr/local/bin

To install in bin, man/man1, include, and lib subdirectories of some
other directory, reset the prefix in the configuration like this:
	% ./configure prefix=/usr/mylocal

For heterogenous computing environments, also set the exec_prefix,
which gives you some flexibility for installing architecture dependent
files (e.g. the programs). For example, the St. Louis installation
sets prefix=/usr/seshare/ exec_prefix=/usr/seshare/`uname`, and for
Linux (for example), this results in:
         executables in   /usr/seshare/Linux/bin
         man pages in     /usr/seshare/man
         header files in  /usr/seshare/include
         libsquid.a in    /usr/seshare/Linux/lib
         scripts in       /usr/seshare/Linux/bin


The configure script has a few other options that may be useful;
./configure --help lists them. An important one is --enable-lfs, which
turns on optional support for LFS, the Large File Summit, which
enables squid to deal with >2 GB files if your system is capable of
it. This is highly recommended, because sequence files can easily
exceed standard 2 GB filesystem limitations these days

FYI, the configuration incantation here in StL is:
  % env CFLAGS="-O3" ./configure --enable-lfs prefix=/usr/seshare/ exec_prefix=/usr/seshare/`uname`
