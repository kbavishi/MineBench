.SH DESCRIPTION

.B seqstat
reads a sequence file
.I seqfile
and shows a number of simple statistics about it.

.pp
The printed statistics include the name of the format, the residue
type of the first sequence (protein, RNA, or DNA), the number of
sequences, the total number of residues, and the average and range of
the sequence lengths.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
.B -a 
Show additional verbose information: a table with one line per
sequence showing name, length, and description line.
These lines are prefixed with a * character to enable

.TP
.B -B
(Babelfish). Autodetect and read a sequence file format other than the
default (FASTA). Almost any common sequence file format is recognized
(including Genbank, EMBL, SWISS-PROT, PIR, and GCG unaligned sequence
formats, and Stockholm, GCG MSF, and Clustal alignment formats). See
the printed documentation for a complete list of supported formats.

.SH EXPERT OPTIONS

.TP
.BI --informat " <s>"
Specify that the sequence file is in format 
.I <s>,
rather than the default FASTA format.
Common examples include Genbank, EMBL, GCG, 
PIR, Stockholm, Clustal, MSF, or PHYLIP; 
see the printed documentation for a complete list
of accepted format names.
This option overrides the default expected format (FASTA)
and the 
.I -B
Babelfish autodetection option.

and date, the parameters and options in effect).
