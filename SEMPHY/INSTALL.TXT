Installation
Unpack:
> tar xzvf semphy-2.0b1.tgz
Go into the top directory:
> cd semphy
Compile
> make all
Test: (there may be some minor diffs between the outputs of the tests and the target outputs that come from precision or order of leaves on trees, so if you do get some minor differences of this sort, your installation is probably still OK)
> make test
And install the executables into the bin directory
> make install
This will place all semphy executables in the "semphy/bin" directory.
