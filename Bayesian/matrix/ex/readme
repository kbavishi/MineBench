matrix - a library for vector and matrix computations

Attention! This library is incomplete: the eigenvalue and eigenvector
functions (file ../src/matrix3.c) are still missing.

This file provides some explanations on how to use the programs transp,
invert, and solve to transpose a matrix, to invert a matrix and to
solve a linear equation system, respectively. However, it does not
explain all options of these programs. For a list of options, call
transp, invert, and solve without any arguments.

Enjoy,

This directory (matrix/ex) contains two matrices (test1.mat and
test2.mat) and three linear equation systems (test1.les to test3.les),
which can be used to test the programs transp, invert, and solve.

The program transp transposes a matrix. Invoking it with
  transp test1.mat out.mat
on the first file, which contains the matrix
  3 2 1
  1 0 2
  4 1 3
should yield the output
  3 1 4
  2 0 1
  1 2 3
This matrix is stored in the file "out.dat" (second program argument).
If a minus sign ('-') is specified instead of a file name, input is read
from standard input or output is sent to standard output, respectively.
Omitting the output file name has the same effect (for the output).
That is, with
  transp test1.mat       or       transp test1.mat -
the output is sent to the terminal.

The program invert inverts a matrix. Since the inverse of the matrix
in the file test1.mat is
  -2/5 -1  4/5
   1    1 -1
   1/5  1 -2/5
applying the program invert with 
  invert test1.mat -o"% .1f"
should yield the output (which goes to the terminal, since no output
file is specified)
  -0.4 -1.0  0.8
   1.0  1.0 -1.0
   0.2  1.0 -0.4
The option -o"% .1f" is used to get a proper alignment of the output:
It specifies the format with which the numbers are printed (for a
description of this format string refer to the documentation of the
C function printf).

The matrix in the file test2.mat is
    9  -36   30
  -36  192 -180
   30 -180  180
Its inverse is
    1  1/2  1/3
  1/2  1/3  1/4
  1/3  1/4  1/5
Therefore
  invert test2.mat -o"%.2f"
should yield
  1.00 0.50 0.33
  0.50 0.33 0.25
  0.33 0.25 0.20

The program solve solves a linear equation system. Such a system is
specified by a coefficient matrix and a right hand side vector. The
input file has the following general format:
  c_11 c_12 ... c_1n   r_1
  c_21 c_22 ... c_2n   r_2
  ...                  ...
  c_n1 c_n2 ... c_nn   r_n
Here c_ij is the coefficient of x_j in the ith equation, r_i is
the right hand side of the ith equation. In matrix/vector form this
specifies the linear equation system
  C * x = r
The linear equation systems in the test files are
test1.les:    4  1    9
              1  9   13
test2.les:    4  6    3
              6 22   -9
test3.les:    4  1  9    9
              1  9  1   13
              9  1 33   23
The solutions of these linear equation systems are
test1.les:    x_1 =  68/35  \approx  1.94286
              x_2 =  43/35  \approx  1.22857
test2.les:    x_1 =  30/13  \approx  2.30769
              x_2 = -27/26  \approx -1.03846
test3.les:    x_1 =  64/55  \approx  1.16364
              x_2 = 281/220 \approx  1.27727
              x_3 =  15/44  \approx  0.340909
