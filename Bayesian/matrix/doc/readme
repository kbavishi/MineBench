matrix - a library for vector and matrix computations

Attention! This library is incomplete: the eigenvalue and eigenvector
functions (file ../src/matrix3.c) are still missing.

This library comes with three programs, namly transp, invert and solve,
which can be used to transpose a matrix, to invert a matrix and to
solve a linear equation system.  A brief explanation of how to use
these programs can be found in the file ../ex/readme. For a list of
options, call them without any arguments.

Enjoy,
